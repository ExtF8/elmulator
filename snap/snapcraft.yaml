summary: Simplifies electrical calculations and optimizes circuit distribution.
description: |
  This app provides essential calculations related to resistance, impedance, and circuit distribution.

  Rings Resistance Calculations:
  Calculate resistance values for various scenarios by inputting resistance values and reviewing calculated outputs in real-time.

  External Impedance Calculations:
  Determine impedance in kilo-amperes based on provided voltage and impedance values, with the option for default values for missing inputs.

  Module for Calculating Circuit Count:
  Streamline the distribution of circuit work among engineers by inputting the number of engineers and circuits, and the app calculates the optimal distribution for single-phase and three-phase circuits.
